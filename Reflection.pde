Setup at line 7 and draw at line 15 are fully working for me, so I score myself excellent 100%.

Marks: (5/5)

===================================

PART D:

I have used many if statements in this sketch.
If statements with branches can be found at lines 390 and 615
Simple if statements can be found at line 21 and 647.
Nested if statements appear at lines 544 and 652
I record an excellent score for this.

Marks: (10/10)

===================================

PART E:

I have multiple examples of loops in my sketch.
For loops are used at lines 182 and 197.
While loops are used at lines 33 and 366.
Nested for loops are used at lines 298 and 315.

I have multiple examples of loops and multiple examples of nested loops
I am recording an excellent mark for this. 100%

Marks: (20/20)

====================================

PART F:

I have several bespoke methods in my sketch.
Methods with no parameters and no return value on lines 277, 331 and 346.
Methods with parameters and no return value on lines 179, 194 and 209.
Method with return value and 2 parameters on line 419.
Overloaded method on line 632 with 10 parameters.
Overloaded method on line 639 with 6 parameters.

I am recording an excellent mark for this section.

Marks: (20/20)

=====================================

PART G:

I have called multiple Processing methods in my sketch.
e.g. strokeWeight at lines 35 and 72
     textSize at lines 257 and 266
     random at line 388
     noFill at line 635
     keyPressed at line 614
I have used more than 4 Processing methods and therefore record an excellent result

Marks: (10/10)

======================================

PART H:

I have used 4 mouse methods altogether for this sketch.
mouseDragged can be found at line 542
mouseMoved can be found at line 594
mouseClicked can be found at line 645
mousePressed can be found at line 651

Apart from the administrative purpose of mouseClicked,
all the other mouse methods integrate meaningfully into my sketch
so I award myself full marks.

Marks: (10/10)

=======================================

PART I:

I have used more than 3 String methods.
String methods can be found at lines 240, 248, 255 and 264.
Use of substring can be found at lines 258 and 260.
This meets the requirement for an excellent grade so I give myself full marks.

Marks: (10/10)

=======================================

PART J:

My program saves the display in a PNG file on a right mouse click

Marks: (3/3)

========================================

PART K:

I have a themed, meaningful and nice-looking image based on an irregular grid. 
The cell contents use colours, transparency, randomness, text, shapes overlayed on each other, 
as well as interactivity. Colours change when you press a key on the keyboard. 
If you move the mouse across the screen, colourful triangles appear. When you press and drag the left 
mouse button in an anti-clockwise direction you see a Palestinian flag increase in size from grid quadrant 
to grid quadrant. Press the mouse with left button to see watermelon half - watch it change depending on 
which half of the grid you click your mouse in.
I have given a lot of effort and consideration to the artistic elements as well as the programming in this sketch.

Marks: (5/5)

========================================

Overall mark: 5+2+5+10+20+20+10+10+10+3+5 = 100
