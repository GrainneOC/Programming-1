Brief description of piece:
===================================================
This sketch is titled "Saoirse don Phailistín" and displays symbols of Palestinian resistance 
through use of a range of methods, loops, interactivity(keyPressed & mouse methods), shapes (triangle, rectangle, and arc), 
colours, lines, and text. A themed palette was created for the sketch to incorporate the Palestinian flag colours.

Instructions:
=============
keyPressed():
If you press any key on the keyboard, you will see the dark green outer petals of the 6 central flowers change to red. 
If you press any key again, it will change back to green.

mouseMoved():
If you move the cursor across the sketch you will see multiple triangles of varying opacity and colour layered on top of each other.

mouseDragged():
If you drag your cursor with left button pressed from the top left quadrant of the grid in an anti-clockwise direction you 
will see a Palestinian flag which increases in size as it enters each new quadrant before returning to orginal size in top left quadrant again.

mousePressed():
Pushing either left or right button on the mouse will remove the cursor from view in the sketch.
If you press the right mouse button in the left half of the grid, you will see a green half watermelon shape with red seeds.
If you press the right mouse button in the right half of the grid, you will see the same sized watermelon shape, 
inverted, and coloured red with green seeds.

If you click the right-hand mouse button a screenshot of the display window will be saved automatically as a .PNG file

Any sources referred to during the development of the assignment:

I found this youtube tutorial on using radians() within arc() easier to follow than Processing.org using PI. This was the approach I used for all arcs within the sketch.

I found it helpful just to glimpse the structure of a substring in this video, despite the video printing it to the console - I was able to apply the structure to my sketch.
